# How to Wysiwyg

Inside of this application is my home spun version of a wysiwyg.

This is built using a mix of Devise to add users, cancancan to denote user privileges,
postgres as a db to keep track of everything, simple_form to make forms easier to
work with.

## Getting started

Start with a ```bundle install``` to get everything up and going.

You will need to add in a secrets.yml file and a database.yml file.

You can then personalize the different abilities and user permissions.


## Eventuallies

At some point the JS for the wysiwyg editor will be pulled out to be it's own implantable
item.
